Existing solutions also lack intelligent planning, require expert operation, and consume large volumes of reagents. MARS offers a compact, low-cost benchtop system with end-to-end automation of bioassays, including cell culture. It supports sub-microliter volumes, reduces reagent use by over 95%, and features an intuitive AI interface."

Its primary users are researchers and lab technicians, whom it supports by automating tasks like well plate preparation, pipetting, sample transfer, and data analysis. This automation reduces workload and improves lab efficiency. For example, MARS can fully automate the cell culture process, from preparation to imaging and analysis. As its capabilities grow, lab directors will be able to use MARS to set high-level research goals for autonomous, iterative experimentation."

Affordable options like Opentrons OT-2 offer greater flexibility but lack key features such as onboard incubation, sub-μL pipetting accuracy, integrated sensors/cameras, and user-friendly software. MARS addresses these gaps by providing a compact, low-cost, all-in-one platform with precise liquid handling (down to 0.1 μL), integrated incubation, imaging, and AI-driven control. It enables closed-loop, end-to-end automation and easy experiment design through an intuitive interface, making advanced cell culture automation accessible to all labs."

            "ai": "Several companies provide lab automation tools, but most fall short in flexibility, cost, usability, or integration; Hamilton Robotics: High-end, bulky, and expensive systems requiring expert training. MARS is compact, affordable, and AI-driven for easy protocol customization by non-experts; Tecan: Modular but complex to set up and limited in third-party integration. MARS simplifies maintenance and calibration via AI and supports customizable hardware; Opentrons: Low-cost and modular, but lacks precision at sub-μL volumes, real-time monitoring, and easy-to-use software. MARS offers accurate low-volume handling, built-in sensors, and AI-assisted protocol generation; Emerald Cloud Lab: Fully remote and automated, but costly, rigid, and opaque in protocol execution. MARS offers a transparent, on-site alternative with full user control and reagent flexibility; Potato AI: Software-only platform needing external hardware. MARS combines both software and hardware for seamless, scalable automation. Overall, MARS stands out by integrating accurate, affordable hardware with intelligent, user-friendly software to support flexible, end-to-end bioassay automation for all lab types."
